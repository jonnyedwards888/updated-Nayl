# Weekly Check-In Boxes Fix

## Problem Description

The weekly check-in boxes on the main page were incorrectly showing filled checkboxes based on `total_days_logged_in` (how many days the user logged into the app) instead of representing actual successful days (days without nail-biting episodes).

**Before:** Checkboxes filled = Days user logged into app
**After:** Checkboxes filled = Days user had no nail-biting episodes (successful days)

## Root Cause

The logic in `HomeScreen.tsx` was using:
```typescript
// OLD LOGIC - INCORRECT
const weeklyArray = Array(7).fill(false).map((_, index) => index < localDashboard.total_days_logged_in);
```

This meant:
- User logs in 5 times → First 5 checkboxes filled
- User logs in 7 times → All checkboxes filled
- **Regardless of whether they had episodes on those days**

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Changes
- Added `successful_days_this_week` column to `user_stats` table
- Updated `user_dashboard` and `user_analytics` views to include this field

### 2. New Tracking Logic
- **`updateSuccessfulDaysTracking(today, hadEpisode)`**: Tracks successful days per week
- **`markTodayAsSuccessful()`**: Manually mark a day as successful
- **Weekly reset**: Resets every Monday (new week starts)

### 3. Updated Weekly Check-In Logic
```typescript
// NEW LOGIC - CORRECT
const weeklyArray = Array(7).fill(false).map((_, index) => index < localDashboard.successful_days_this_week);
```

### 4. Automatic Success Detection
- When user opens app, checks if today had any episodes
- If no episodes today → automatically marks as successful
- If episodes today → doesn't mark as successful

### 5. Episode Tracking Integration
- When user saves a trigger (episode), calls `updateSuccessfulDaysTracking(today, true)`
- This ensures the weekly count reflects actual behavior

## Files Modified

1. **`supabase-schema.sql`** - Added new column and updated views
2. **`src/lib/supabase.ts`** - Updated TypeScript interfaces
3. **`src/services/sessionService.ts`** - Added success tracking methods
4. **`src/services/triggerService.ts`** - Integrated with episode tracking
5. **`src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx`** - Updated weekly check-in logic
6. **`add-successful-days-column.sql`** - Migration script for existing databases

## How It Works Now

1. **Monday (Day 1)**: User has no episodes → Checkbox 1 filled
2. **Tuesday (Day 2)**: User has no episodes → Checkbox 2 filled  
3. **Wednesday (Day 3)**: User has an episode → Checkbox 3 stays empty
4. **Thursday (Day 4)**: User has no episodes → Checkbox 4 filled
5. **Friday (Day 5)**: User has no episodes → Checkbox 5 filled
6. **Saturday (Day 6)**: User has an episode → Checkbox 6 stays empty
7. **Sunday (Day 7)**: User has no episodes → Checkbox 7 filled

**Result**: 5 out of 7 checkboxes filled, representing actual progress toward the goal.

## Benefits

- ✅ **Accurate Progress**: Checkboxes now represent real achievement
- ✅ **Motivational**: Users see actual progress, not just login frequency
- ✅ **Goal-Oriented**: Aligns with the app's purpose (stop nail-biting)
- ✅ **Weekly Reset**: Fresh start every week for continued motivation
- ✅ **Automatic Tracking**: No manual input required from users

## Migration

For existing databases, run the `add-successful-days-column.sql` script in your Supabase SQL Editor to add the new column and update the views.

## Testing

The fix includes mock data in `getLocalDashboard()` and `getLocalAnalytics()` methods, so you can test the new logic immediately without database changes.
